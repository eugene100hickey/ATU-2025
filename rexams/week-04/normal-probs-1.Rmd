Question
========
Average annual rainfall in the North Coast of California is `r rain_mean`cm with a standard deviation of `r rain_sd`cm. Calculate the probability of a year having more than `r rain`cm of rain.



Solution
========
Use pnorm(q = `r rain`, mean = `r rain_mean`, sd = `r rain_sd`, lower.tail = FALSE)
