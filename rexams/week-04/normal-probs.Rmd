Question
========
Soil samples from a coastal area have a mean pH value of `r ph_mean` with a standard deviation of `r ph_sd`. Calculate the probability that a given soil sample will have a pH value between `r ph_lower` and `r ph_higher`.



Solution
========
The command `pnorm(`r ph_higher`, `r ph_mean`, `r ph_sd`)` will give the probability of a sample being less than `r ph_higher`. The command `pnorm(`r ph_lower`, `r ph_mean`, `r ph_sd`)` will give the probability of a sample being less than `r ph_lower`. The difference will give answer needed.
