Question
========
In a class of __`r class_size`__ students, there is a pass rate of __`r pass_rate`__ in a given exam. Calculate the probability that at least __`r pass_numbers`__ students pass the exam. Give your answer as a probabilty between 0 and 1, and give it to three significant figures.



Solution
========
Because it is _at least_ in the question, we need to use `r pass_numbers` - 1, and `lower.tail = FALSE`. So use `pbinom(q = `r pass_numbers-1`, size = `r class_size`,  prob = `r pass_rate`, lower.tail = F)`.
