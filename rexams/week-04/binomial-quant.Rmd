Question
========
In a series of drug trials, each trial has `r drug_num` patients. The drug has a `r drug_prob*100`% success rate. For `r drug_q*100`% of the trials we can expect between 0-`N` patients to recover, calculate the value for `N`.


Solution
========
Use `qbinom(p = `r drug_q`, size = `r drug_num`, prob = `r drug_prob`, lower.tail=TRUE)`.
