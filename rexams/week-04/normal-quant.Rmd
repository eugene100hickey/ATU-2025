Question
========
Drumcondra test scores for a large school have an average value of `r drum_mean` and a standard deviation of `r drum_sd`. Calculate the score below which `r drum_prob*100`% of the pupils score.



Solution
========
The command `qnorm(`r drum_prob`, `r drum_mean`, `r drum_sd`)` should give the answer.
