Question
========
Install the `dslabs` package if you haven't already (`install.packages("dslabs")`. The `murders` dataset contains a list of US states by region with their number of murders and population.

Use `mutate()` to create a new variable of the ratio of murders to population. Use `filter()` to keep just the states from the __`r my_region`__. Arrange the ratio of murders to population in descending order. Finally, choose the state in the __`r scales::label_ordinal()(my_number)`__ position. 


Answerlist
----------
* `r solution[1]`
* `r solution[2]`
* `r solution[3]`
* `r solution[4]`
* `r solution[5]`
* `r solution[6]`


Solution
========
Use the R command `mutate(ratio = total / population)` followed by `filter(region == "`r my_region`")`, and then `arrange(desc(ratio))`.

Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
* False
* False
