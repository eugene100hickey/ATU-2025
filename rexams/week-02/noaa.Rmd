Question
========
Install the `rnoaa` package if you don't have it already. To use it, you'll need to register at __*https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token*__, they email you a token that you can place within your R session by `options(noaakey = "KEY_EMAILED_TO_YOU")` (see https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa/articles/rnoaa.html). 

We want to find the average rainfall in __`r station_name`__ for the year starting __`r start_date`__ through to __`r end_date`__.  

You can access information about the Irish weather stations from `ncdc_stations(locationid = "FIPS:EI")$data`. Access rainfall data (called "PRCP") using the `ncdc()` command. Set the `stationid` to the appropriate _id_ value for `r station_name`. Set the `startdate` and `enddate` appropriately. The `datasetid` is _"GHCND"_, and the `datatypeid` is _"PRCP"_. The values returned are in tenths of mm, so expect an average value to be somewhere generally from 10 to 100. 


Solution
========
Use `ncdc_stations(locationid = "FIPS:EI")$data`, then `ncdc(datasetid='GHCND',  stationid="`r ghcnd`", datatypeid='PRCP', startdate = "`r start_date`", enddate = "`r end_date`", limit=500, add_units = TRUE)$data`.
